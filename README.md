# scheduler-simulator

This is the project I made for my Operating Systems class using Compose for desktop. 
Is simulates a scheduler using the following algorithms:

- FIFO
- Shortest job first
- Round robin
- Non-preemptive static priority
- Preemptive static priority

For layout inspiration, I've used [this](https://github.com/Joseph-Kocis/Process-Scheduling-Visualizer)
